# LLM Research Diary

I have recently had the opportunity to start working on building LLM-based chatbots. I wanted to document my research and (potentially) learnings here.

I wanted this to be called LLM diary instead of NLP diary because LLMs are now their own serparate strain of research - especially given that you can see such a difference in performance based on how you change training them, fine-tuning them and how you prompt them. I will (hopefully) update these regularly.
